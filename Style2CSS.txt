# Prompt for Obsidian Plugin Style Refactoring

When providing guidance on refactoring my Obsidian plugin's styles, please follow these principles:

1. **Preserve Dynamic Functionality**: Recognize that certain inline JavaScript styles are essential when they're directly tied to user input, runtime conditions, or functional positioning. Don't blindly convert all inline styles to CSS classes if it would break this functionality.

2. **Use Class Toggling for State Changes**: For binary states (visible/hidden, active/inactive, error states), suggest CSS classes that can be toggled with JavaScript rather than direct style manipulation.

3. **Namespace All CSS Classes**: Ensure all CSS classes use a unique plugin-specific prefix to prevent theme conflicts (e.g., `my-plugin-hidden` instead of just `hidden`).

4. **Balance Practicality with Best Practices**: Acknowledge that sometimes inline styles are the most practical solution, particularly for calculated values or position adjustments based on user settings.

5. **Leverage Obsidian CSS Variables**: Use Obsidian's built-in variables like `var(--text-error)` where appropriate to maintain theme compatibility.

6. **Provide Clear Justification**: For any inline styles that should remain, explain exactly why they cannot or should not be moved to CSS.

7. **Respect Existing Structure**: Do not alter or remove HTML structure unless absolutely essential to meet the styling goals.

8. **Consider Optional Enhancements**: Where appropriate, suggest improvements like Shadow DOM for style isolation or ARIA roles for accessibility.

9. Be wary not to brake things the following  was a particulare hard issue to stop reoccurring avoid at all costs: 
Root-cause found: the “channel options” block is no longer hidden at start because the new helper classes we’re now using (e.g. tubesage-display-none, tubesage-display-block, validation colour/visibility helpers) were never injected into the modal’s runtime stylesheet.
Without a rule like .tubesage-display-none { display:none; } the element’s default display remained block, so it was always visible.
Fixes applied:
Added the missing helper CSS inside the injected styleEl (so it’s guaranteed to load even if the external styles.css isn’t picked up):
• .tubesage-display-block / -none
• .tubesage-validation-visible / -hidden / -error / -success / -accent
Re-aligned the Enter-key handler with our class-based show/hide logic—removed the remaining inline style.display commands and replaced them with the same addClass/removeClass operations used in the input listener.
This eliminates conflicting inline styles and keeps behaviour consistent.
Result:
• channelOptionsContainer now starts hidden, then appears only when a channel/playlist URL is detected via the real-time input listener (pasting or typing).
• No more permanently-visible “All videos / Limited Number” panel.
